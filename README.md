# SÃ¶derDaily ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ªâœ¨

Nothing fascinates me as much as memes.  
After moving to Germany, I found myself discovering the local culture through humor â€” and naturally, that led me to Markus SÃ¶der.

This simple Telegram bot sends out a random SÃ¶der quote on command. Built just for fun, to celebrate *StabilitÃ¤t* and the unique charm of Bavarian politics.
